#  MarkorTechnology Blueprint Is the Latest Casino Owner to Enter the Industry

# The document leaked yesterday, revealing that the MarkorTechnology company, who owns and operates a number of large casinos across the world, plans to expand their operations into the online gambling market.

# While the company has yet to make an official announcement, industry insiders suggest that they will be using their know-how in running large-scale land-based casinos to create an online platform that is user friendly and easy to navigate.

# This move comes as no surprise as the global online gambling market is estimated to be worth $52.5 billion by 2020, with a growth rate of 6.2%. As such, it is a lucrative industry that is ripe for investment.

# It is also interesting to note that this announcement comes just days after Las Vegas Sands Corporation, the largest casino operator in the world, revealed their own plans to enter the online gambling market. In doing so, they are hoping to capitalize on the growing demand for gambling services in Asian countries such as China and Japan.

# So far, there has been mixed reactions to these announcements from both the casino owners and analysts. While some believe that this will lead to increased competition and improved standards in the industry, others warn that it could lead to an oversupply of services and a price war.
