#  Who Knew 5 Card Poker Could Have So Many Possible Hands?

There are so many possible hands in 5 card poker, that some players might not know all of them. This article will explore some of the more common and/or interesting hands in this game.

There are 10, birthday, straight flush, four of a kind, full house, flush, three of a kind, two pair, and one pair.

The 10 is a hand that contains two cards of one rank and three cards of another rank. For example, two tens and three kings. This hand is very rare and usually only occurs when using wildcards.

A birthday is a hand that has all five cards with the same rank. This happens once every 52 cards or twice in a deck of 104 cards. It's called a 'birthday' because there are only 1 out of every 52 chances of getting it.

A straight flush is a hand that has five consecutive cards with the same suit. This hand is also very rare and usually only occurs when using wildcards.

There are four different kinds of four-of-a-kinds: plain four-of-a-kinds (four cards of the same rank), double pairs (two sets of two identical ranks), mixed ranks (one pair each of two different ranks), and ascending (A K Q J 10). The ascending variety is the most common with about 1 out of every 72 packs containing it. The other three types are considerably rarer with odds ranging from 1 in 1159 to 1 in 3144 packs.

A full house contains three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. Examples would be three sixes and two queens or three jacks and two kings. Full houses occur approximately 1 time in every 6 games on average.

A flush is a hand that has all five cards with the same suit but not necessarily in consecutive order. A flush occurs approximately once every 13 hands on average. 

A straight is a hand that has all five cards with consecutive ranks but not necessarily the same suit as the Flush mentioned above stats about once every 22 hands on average
