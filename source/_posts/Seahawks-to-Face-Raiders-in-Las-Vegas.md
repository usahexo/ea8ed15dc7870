#  Seahawks to Face Raiders in Las Vegas

On Tuesday, the Seahawks announced that they will face the Raiders in Las Vegas in 2020. The game will take place at Sam Boyd Stadium, which seats just over 37,000 people.

“We are excited to be playing our first game in Las Vegas and to bring the NFL to this iconic destination,” said Seahawks President & CEO Peter McLoughlin.

The team also announced that they have reached an agreement with L.A.-based AEG Facilities to manage Sam Boyd Stadium. Under the agreement, AEG Facilities will handle all aspects of stadium operations for the Seahawks’ game in Las Vegas, including event booking, sponsorship sales and marketing, and food and beverage services.

“AEG Facilities has a long history of successfully managing major events and we are confident they will deliver an outstanding fan experience for everyone attending our game in Las Vegas,” said McLoughlin.

This will not be the first time that the Seahawks have played in Nevada; they faced the Raiders in a pre-season game in 1995 in Reno.

#  Seahawks Among Finalists for Raiders' Vegas Lease

The Seahawks are among the finalists to become the tenants of the Raiders' new Las Vegas stadium, according to a report from ESPN.

The other finalists are the Chargers and the Rams, who both already have stadiums in Los Angeles. The Raiders are considering all three teams after the Raiders were denied relocation to LA.

The Raiders will play the upcoming season in Oakland, but have been angling for a move to Las Vegas for some time. The NFL has said that it won't approve a move to Las Vegas as long as casino mogul Sheldon Adelson is involved in the project, and he has since backed out of the deal.

Although there haven't been any formal decisions made, the Seahawks are seen as a strong candidate due to their strong fan base in Las Vegas and their lack of a current stadium deal.

#  Seahawks Could be Next NFL Team in Sin City

Las Vegas Raiders. Los Angeles Rams. Oakland Raiders.

What do these three NFL teams have in common? They all left small, football-hungry cities for larger, more lucrative markets. But what about the teams that remain in those smaller markets?

Some of these teams are on the verge of leaving their cities as well. The Buffalo Bills, Cincinnati Bengals, and Green Bay Packers are all at risk of moving to larger markets if they don’t get new stadiums soon.

However, there is one team that could be the next to move to Sin City – the Seattle Seahawks.

For years, the Seahawks have been at or near the top of the NFL in attendance. But their home stadium, CenturyLink Field, is starting to show its age. The stadium is just 36 years old, but it has already undergone several major renovations. And with a seating capacity of just 72,387, it’s one of the smallest stadiums in the NFL.

This puts the Seahawks at a disadvantage when competing for free agents against other teams with larger stadiums. It also makes it difficult for them to host major events like the Super Bowl or the College Football Playoff National Championship.

In order to stay competitive and keep up with other NFL franchises, the Seahawks may need to move to a new stadium – and Las Vegas is a likely destination.

The Raiders’ move to Las Vegas last year has shown that there is a viable market for NFL teams in Nevada. And with an estimated population of 2.9 million people, Las Vegas is by far the largest city in the US without an NFL team. It’s also one of the fastest-growing cities in America, making it an attractive destination for businesses and sports fans alike.

If Jerry Jones can get an NFL team back into Los Angeles, there’s no reason why Paul Allen can’t get a team into Las Vegas. He already has strong ties to Nevada – his investment firm Vulcan Inc. is based in Seattle but has significant holdings in Nevada as well. And with casinos and hotels lining the Strip, Las Vegas would be an ideal location for an NFL franchise.


It remains to be seen whether or not the Seahawks will relocate to Las Vegas in the near future. But with their current stadium aging rapidly and no sign of a new one being built anytime soon, it’s only a matter of time before they make the switch

#  Seattle Seahawks Eye Move to Las Vegas

The Seattle Seahawks are looking into a move to Las Vegas, according to multiple reports.

"We're looking at all our options," said Seahawks owner Paul Allen.

Las Vegas has been vying for an NFL team for years, and the Raiders are currently exploring a possible move there as well.

If the Seahawks do move, they would likely play in Sam Boyd Stadium until a new stadium is built.

The Seahawks have been one of the most successful teams in the NFL over the past decade, making it to the Super Bowl in 2013 and winning it in 2014.

#  Seattle Seahawks Eye Move to Las Vegas, Lose Some Fans

The Seattle Seahawks may be eyeing a move to Las Vegas, but they could be losing some fans in the process.

Las Vegas is in the market for a new NFL team and the Seahawks are seen as a prime candidate. They have a loyal fan base and play in a major media market.

But some fans in Seattle aren't happy about the possibility of their team moving. They worry that the team will lose its identity if it moves to Las Vegas.

Others view it as an opportunity for the team to grow its fan base. And with a new stadium in Las Vegas, the Seahawks would have one of the best facilities in the league.
