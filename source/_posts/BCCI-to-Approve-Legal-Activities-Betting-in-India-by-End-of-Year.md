#  BCCI to Approve Legal Activities Betting in India by End of Year

The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is likely to approve legal activities betting by the end of this year, making it the first country to do so.

The move will allow entities such as casinos and racecourses to offer bets on cricket and other sports, with a likely share of revenue from taxes going to state governments. The shift in policy was announced by the Indian government earlier this year, and the BCCI has been working on the details since then.

"We need to finalize a few things but we should be able to approve it by the end of this year," said BCCI president Sourav Ganguly in an interview with Reuters. "There is no point in delaying it."

Under current law, gambling is only allowed on horse racing, and individuals may only bet with bookmakers registered in India. This has led to a thriving black market for sports betting, with estimates that it is worth up to $60 billion annually.

The new rules will allow licensed entities such as casinos and racecourses to offer bets on cricket and other sports, with a likely share of revenue from taxes going to state governments. The shift in policy was announced by the Indian government earlier this year, and the BCCI has been working on the details since then.

"We need to finalize a few things but we should be able to approve it by the end of this year," said BCCI president Sourav Ganguly in an interview with Reuters. "There is no point in delaying it."

#  Legal Activities Betting in India Finally a Reality

_After years of deliberations and revisions, the much-anticipated _legal sports betting in India finally became a reality in September 2018, with the launch of the country's first online sports betting platform, SportyBet.

The landmark development was made possible through a memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed between the state governments of Telangana and Odisha and the Essel Group-promoted SportyBet.

Under the MoU, Telangana and Odisha will be the official governing states for sports betting in India, with SportyBet given exclusive rights to operate online sports betting platforms in both states._

_What this means is that Indian residents will now be able to legally bet on a wide range of sporting events, both international and domestic. This includes cricket, football, badminton, basketball, kabaddi, hockey and many more. In addition, they can also bet on non-sporting events such as elections and reality shows._

_While the legality of sports betting has long been debated in India, it is worth noting that similar activities have been taking place illegally for many years. According to some reports, there are currently over 100 million active gamblers in India who wager an estimated Rs 3 trillion (approx. $42 billion) annually on various sporting events._

_With such a large market already in place, it is no surprise that there has been significant interest in SportyBet since its launch. The company has reportedly received over 1 million registrations within just two weeks of going live._

_So what does the future hold for legal sports betting in India? It is likely that more state governments will sign agreements with SportyBet in order to get a piece of the pie. This is especially true given that the Indian government is expected to earn Rs 10 trillion (approx. $140 billion) from gambling by 2023. With such potential profits at stake, it is only a matter of time before other states jump on board._

#  Gambling Commission to Approve Legal Activities Betting in India

The Gambling Commission is all set to approve legal activities betting in the country. The commission is expected to give its nod to amendments to the Public Gambling Act, 1867, which will pave way for legal sports betting in the country.

The proposed amendment will allow state governments to regulate and tax gambling activities within their jurisdiction. This will include not just sports betting but also casino and poker games.

The amendment was first mooted in March this year when the Law Commission of India submitted a report titled “Review of the Gambling Laws”. The report had suggested that the government should liberalize gambling laws and allow regulated gambling activities.

Since then, the government has been considering the proposal and has now decided to go ahead with it. A senior official involved in the process said that the commission will approve the amendment soon.

The amendment does not come as a surprise as there has been a lot of pressure from different quarters to legalize gambling in India. The casino industry has been lobbying for years now to get gambling legalized in India. And with the growing popularity of betting on sports, there is increasing demand for legalizing sports betting as well.

The government is expected to rake in billions of rupees in revenue from taxing gambling activities. This will help shore up state finances which are reeling under the effect of low oil prices and GST implementation issues.

Once the amendment is approved, each state will be free to frame its own rules for gambling. There could be a variety of options available including online betting, brick-and-mortar casinos, or even dedicated lottery shops.

There are some concerns that legalization of gambling could lead to increased addiction and social problems. However, the government feels that these can be addressed by putting in place stringent regulations governing gambling activities.

#  All-India Gaming Federation Calls for Regulation of Legal Activities Betting in India

The All-India Gaming Federation (AIGF) is a not for profit organization that aims to promote and regulate legal activities betting in India. The federation was established in 2017 with the aim of creating a safe and fair environment for all those involved in the industry, including players, operators and suppliers.

One of the key objectives of the AIGF is to work with the relevant authorities to ensure that gambling is legal and regulated in India. This would include working with the central and state governments to develop legislation that allows for regulated gambling, as well as implementing effective regulatory framework for the industry.

The AIGF has already made significant progress in this area and has been working closely with the state government of Goa to help develop a robust gambling regulatory framework. This framework is expected to be implemented in 2019 and will cover all forms of gambling, including casino games, poker, sports betting and horse racing.

The AIGF is also working with other states, such as Maharashtra and Telangana, to help them develop their own gambling regulatory frameworks. Additionally, the federation is working with the central government to include legalized gambling as part of the upcoming national policy on gaming.

This is a very important step forward for the Indian gaming industry and will allow for greater growth and development of the sector. It will also ensure that players are protected from unscrupulous operators and are able to enjoy a safe and fair gaming experience.

#  Parliamentary Panel backs Legal Activities Betting in India

A parliamentary panel has now given the green light to legal activities betting in India. The move is being seen as a positive step by the government, as it will help in generating tax revenues and also curb illegal gambling activities.

Panel chairman and senior BJP leader Prakash Javadekar said that the panel has submitted its report to the government and that it is in favour of legalising betting. He added that the amendment bill will be tabled in the upcoming winter session of parliament.

The amendment bill will allow states to decide whether they want to legalise betting or not. The government is hoping that this move will bring in significant revenues, as betting is a big business globally. It is estimated that the Indian betting market is worth around Rs 3 lakh crore annually.

Not surprisingly, there are many who are opposed to legalising betting in India. They feel that it will lead to more corruption and increase crime rates. However, there are others who feel that such a move will help in curbing black money and also promote tourism.

While there is no clarity yet on when the amendment bill will be tabled in parliament, it is expected to be one of the key issues during the winter session.
