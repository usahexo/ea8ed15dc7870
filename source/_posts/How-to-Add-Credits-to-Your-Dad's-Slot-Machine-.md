#  How to Add Credits to Your Dad's Slot Machine 

Giving your dad a present always entails some level of risk-taking. But if there's one thing we know about dads, it's that they love slot machines. So we've put together a fool-proof guide on how to add credits to your dad's slot machine, so you can make sure he has the best Father's Day ever!

This part is easy - all you need is a dollar bill and a pen. Just find an open spot on the bill and write in how many credits you want to add. Be sure to use a pen that will show up well against the background of the bill - otherwise it might be tough for your dad to see what you wrote!

Once you've added your credits, all that's left to do is sit back and watch your dad have a blast playing his favorite game. And if he happens to hit the jackpot, well... that's just icing on the cake!
