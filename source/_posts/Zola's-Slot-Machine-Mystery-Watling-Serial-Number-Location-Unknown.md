#  Zola's Slot Machine Mystery: Watling Serial Number Location Unknown

The Watling Manufacturing Company was a prolific maker of slot machines in the early 20th century. While their machines were popular, the company has become more known in recent years for the mystery surrounding their serial number location.

Zola's Slot Machine Mystery documents the efforts of one casino owner, Frank Zola, to locate the whereabouts of the Watling Manufacturing Company's serial number stamp. Zola believes that if he can find it, he can argue that his slot machines are exempt from a recent state law that requires casinos to use newer machines with certain security features.

The search for the Watling Manufacturing Company's serial number stamp has taken Zola all over the country, but he has been unable to find any definitive clues. The stamp is thought to be either on the inside or outside of the machine, but no one seems to know for sure.

In the end, Zola's efforts may be for naught. The state law mandating new security features for slot machines is set to take effect in January of 2020 and it is unclear whether Zola will be able to keep his older machines running past that date.
