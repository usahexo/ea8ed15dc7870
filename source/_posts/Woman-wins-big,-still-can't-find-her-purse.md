#  Woman wins big, still can't find her purse

A Los Angeles woman who won an $8 million jackpot in a state lottery says she can't find her purse.

The 51-year-old unidentified woman told California Lottery officials she was so excited after winning the jackpot Saturday that she put her purse down somewhere and can't find it.

She says she's been searching for the purse ever since.

Lottery officials say they presented the woman with a check for $4 million on Wednesday. They say she declined the offer of a lump sum payment and will instead receive annual payments over 25 years.

The unidentified woman purchased her ticket at a liquor store in downtown Los Angeles.

#  What to do when your purse is stolen at the casino

If your purse is stolen while you are at the casino, there are a few steps you can take to try and get it back.

First, report the theft to security. They will likely have aLost and Found department that may be able to help you recover your belongings.

Second, reach out to your friends, family, and social media networks for help. Someone may have seen something or may know who stole your purse.

Finally, contact the police. If they have any leads, they may be able to track down your belongings.

It's important to remember that not all casinos have Lost and Found departments, so be sure to ask ahead of time. And if you don't live near the casino, it's also important to notify the local police department so they can keep an eye out for any suspicious activity.

#  Casino thefts on the rise: woman's purse missing after night of gambling

It's no secret that casino thefts are on the rise. In fact,according to the latest statistics from the National Crime Victimization Survey, more than $40 million was stolen from casinos across the US in 2016. This is a big increase from just $15 million in 2012.

While there are many reasons for this rise in theft, one of the main reasons is that casinos are becoming increasingly popular targets for thieves. With large sums of money on hand, and relatively lax security measures, it's no wonder that criminals are targeting casinos more and more.

One recent example of this is a woman whose purse was stolen while she was gambling at a casino in Las Vegas. According to reports, the woman had her purse snatched from her chair while she was playing blackjack. The thief made off with over $1,000 in cash and credit cards.

This type of theft is becoming increasingly common at casinos across the country. In fact, according to one study, nearly half of all casino thefts involve someone snatching a victim's purse or wallet. This makes it important for casino-goers to be aware of the dangers and take steps to protect themselves.

Some tips for keeping your belongings safe while gambling at a casino include:

- Keeping your purse or wallet close by at all times
- Avoid bringing large sums of cash with you to the casino
- Making use of safe deposit boxes if you plan to gamble with large amounts of cash
- Notifying the casino staff if you see anyone acting suspiciously

#  Tips for keeping your belongings safe while gambling

When you go to a casino, the last thing you want to worry about is your belongings. Here are some tips for keeping your belongings safe while gambling:

1. Make sure to keep your belongings with you at all times. Casinos are packed with people, and it can be easy for someone to snatch your belongings if you're not paying attention.

2. Invest in a good quality wallet or purse that offers plenty of security features. Your wallet or purse should have a zipper or snap closure, and it should be made from a sturdy material like leather.

3. Don't bring any unnecessary items with you to the casino. The fewer items you have to worry about, the less chance there is of something getting lost or stolen.

4. If you're going to be gambling for a while, leave your most valuable items at home. It's not worth the risk of losing them while you're playing games or slots.

5. Be aware of your surroundings at all times and keep an eye on anyone who seems suspicious. If you notice anything that makes you uncomfortable, leave the casino and report the incident to security.
