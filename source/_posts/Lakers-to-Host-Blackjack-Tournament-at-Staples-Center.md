#  Lakers to Host Blackjack Tournament at Staples Center

The Lakers will be hosting a blackjack tournament at Staples Center on November 18th. The tournament will feature celebrities and other VIPs, with the proceeds benefiting the Lakers Youth Foundation.

"This is a great opportunity for our fans to get involved with the Lakers and have some fun too," said Lakers President of Business Operations, Jeanie Buss. "The Lakers Youth Foundation does great work in the community, and this is a way for us to help support them."

The blackjack tournament will begin at 6:00 pm on November 18th and will be open to the public. Tickets are $250 per person and include entry into the tournament, food, drinks, and a gift bag. For more information or to purchase tickets, please visit www.lakers.com/blackjacktournament.

#  Lakers to Offer Blackjack as an Alternative to Traditional Season Tickets

--

The Lakers are about to offer their fans an interesting new option for buying season tickets this year. Instead of buying tickets for a specific set of games, fans will be able to buy "blackjack cards" which will give them the right to attend any game they want, as long as there is still available seating. The team expects this to be a popular choice among fans, as it gives them more flexibility in terms of when they can go to games and how many they can attend.

While the Lakers have not released detailed information about the blackjack card program yet, they have said that prices will start at around $200 per card. This is a bit more expensive than traditional season tickets, but it's likely that many fans will find it to be worth the extra cost given the added flexibility. It's also possible that the Lakers will offer discounts on merchandise and concession items to people who purchase blackjack cards.

There has been some speculation that other teams in the NBA may follow suit and begin offering their own blackjack card programs. This would be a major shift in how teams sell tickets, and it's likely that many teams would see significant increases in ticket sales if they offered this type of program. For now, though, it appears that the Lakers are leading the way in terms of alternative ticketing methods.
