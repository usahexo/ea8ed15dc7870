#  Moby Dick game build during the golden age of casino gaming!

The Moby Dick slot game was inspired by the classic novel of the same name by Herman Melville and released in 1948 by Bally Manufacturing. The game is designed as a five reel, ten payout line machine that pays out when three or more of the same symbol appear on consecutive reels, left to right. The symbols are all related to the story with images of whales, dolphins, anchors, and sailing ships.

One of the unique features of Moby Dick is that it includes a "second chance" feature which allows players to respin any or all of their losing symbols in order to improve their chances of hitting a payout. This feature was unusual for the time and helped contribute to the game's popularity.

Moby Dick is also notable for being one of the first games to offer a progressive jackpot. This means that the jackpot amount increases with each spin until it is won. The Moby Dick jackpot started at $10,000 and grew quickly over its first few months on the market. In fact, it reached an impressive $100,000 by 1949!

Interestingly, there is some debate about whether or not Moby Dick was actually the first progressive slot game ever released. Some historians claim that a game called "Jackpot" released by Mills Novelty Company in 1933 was actually the first progressive slot machine. However, there is no concrete evidence to support this claim so Moby Dick remains the most recognized progessive slot game from history.
