#  Why Does She Express Bingo at the End Netherlands Antilles?

There is always one that believes in hearsay or superstition and there's nothing wrong with it as long as harms nobody. It would be safe to say that a lot of people around the world believe in some sort of superstition; whether it is good luck or bad luck, crossing fingers for something or knocking on wood. Countries, provinces and states have their own little quirks when it comes to superstitions and the Netherlands Antilles is no different. One of the most popular superstitions in the area is the saying "express bingo at the end", but what does this mean?

When somebody says they are going to express bingo at the end, it means that they are going to do everything they can to ensure good luck before leaving whatever situation they are in. This can involve anything from saying a prayer to spitting on their shoes. Some people even carry around lucky charms or tokens with them to give them an extra edge. While the tradition may seem a little strange to outsiders, many people in the Netherlands Antilles believe in its power and use it regularly without incident.

So why do they do it? There isn't one definitive answer, but there are a few theories out there. One theory suggests that it originated from slaves who were brought over from Africa hundreds of years ago. These slaves were believed to have brought over their own traditions and superstitions, which eventually blended in with those of the Dutch settlers. Another theory suggests that it has something to do with Christianity and the act of blessing oneself before entering church. No matter where it came from, the tradition is now firmly entrenched in Dutch culture and shows no signs of disappearing anytime soon!
