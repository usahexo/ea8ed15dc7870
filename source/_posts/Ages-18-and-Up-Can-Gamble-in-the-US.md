#  Ages 18 and Up Can Gamble in the US

#

In the United States, the age requirement to gamble is 18 years old. This includes casino gambling, playing poker in a casino, and betting on sports. There are some states that allow people who are younger than 18 to gamble in specific cases. For instance, in Nevada, it is legal for those aged 17 and older to play poker in a casino, as long as they are not on the premises of an establishment that serves alcohol. In New Jersey, it is legal for those aged 16 and older to gamble in casinos and Atlantic City. However, these minors must be accompanied by an adult while they are gambling.

There are some states where the age requirement to gamble is 21 years old. In these states, people who are 18 or 19 years old can only gamble in specific cases. For instance, in Oregon, it is legal for those aged 18 through 20 to gamble in casinos, but they cannot bet on sports. In California, it is legal for those aged 18 through 20 to gamble at horse racing tracks and certain tribal casinos, but they cannot bet on any other type of game.

The age requirement to gamble varies from state to state because the laws governing gambling are determined at the state level. The federal government does not have any laws regulating gambling age requirements.

#  Gambling at 18: What are the Rules Anyway?

Gambling laws vary from country to country and even from state to state within the United States. However, there are some general rules that apply worldwide. In most cases, you must be 18 years of age or older to gamble. This is true for casino games, lotteries, and sports betting.

There are a few exceptions to this rule. Some countries allow gambling at 16 or 17 years of age. And in some jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, you can gamble at age 18 if you are accompanied by an adult.

There are also some activities that are considered gambling but don’t fall under the 18+ rule. For example, bingo is often played by people of all ages. Slot machines may also be frequented by people of all ages, depending on the location. But these games typically have lower stakes than casino games or sports betting, so they are generally seen as more innocuous.

Why is 18 the magic number when it comes to gambling? The reason might have something to do with maturity levels. Most people reach legal adulthood at 18 and thus are considered legally responsible for their actions. Gambling laws exist to protect people from making uninformed decisions that could lead to financial harm. By requiring people to be at least 18 years old before they can gamble, lawmakers believe that players will have had enough time to learn about the risks involved in playing games of chance.

If you’re curious about specific gambling laws in your area, it’s best to consult an attorney or your local gaming authority.

#  UK Gambling Age Set to be Lowered to 18

The UK Gambling Commission is set to propose a change in the country's gambling age from 18 to 16, in a move that could see the industry worth £14bn by 2025.

The proposal, which will be announced on Thursday, is part of a review into the gambling industry that is being carried out by the commission. The review is expected to recommend a number of changes to the way the gambling industry is run in the UK, including measures to protect vulnerable people from harm.

If the proposal is accepted, it would mean that people in the UK would be able to gamble at 16 years old across all forms of gambling, including online and in betting shops. The change would not apply to casinos, however, as these are currently subject to a minimum age of 21.

In a statement announcing the proposal, Neil McArthur, chief executive of the Gambling Commission, said: "It is time our gambling rules caught up with how young people are now living their lives. Our proposals will put protections for children and young people at the heart of our licensing system."

The commission has said that any changes to the gambling age would be introduced gradually over a number of years, in order to give businesses time to adapt.

The proposal has been welcomed by betting shops and bookmakers, who argue that it will bring Britain's gambling age into line with other European countries. However, it has been met with criticism from anti-gambling campaigners who argue that it will lead to an increase in problem gambling among young people.

#  Is it Time to Lower the Gambling Age in Australia?

It’s been a while since the gambling age in Australia was last debated, but with new evidence to support a change, it might be time to reconsider.

When it comes to gambling, Australia is a bit of an anomaly. While the legal age for gambling is 18 in countries such as the United States and Canada, it’s only 16 in Australia. This seems to be at odds with our general attitude towards alcohol and cigarettes - both of which are available to adults at 18. So why is gambling different?

There are a few reasons for this discrepancy. For one, gambling is seen as less harmful than alcohol or cigarettes. It’s also seen as more socially acceptable, with most people participating without any negative consequences. And finally, there’s the fact that casinos are often seen as tourist attractions, which brings in revenue for the country.

However, there’s now evidence that suggests that lowering the gambling age could have some positive outcomes. A recent study by Deakin University found that increasing the gambling age from 16 to 18 would lead to a significant decrease in problem gambling rates. This is because at 16, many young people aren’t yet fully developed cognitively and are more prone to developing problems with gambling later on in life.

So should we be looking at changing the gambling age in Australia? There are pros and cons to both sides of the argument, but ultimately it comes down to personal choice. If you think that people should be able to gamble at 16 if they so choose, then you may be opposed to any change in the law. However, if you think that people are too impressionable at 16 and are more likely to develop problems with gambling later on in life, then you may support raising the age limit.

Whatever your opinion on this issue may be, it’s definitely something that needs to be discussed further. With new evidence supporting a change, it might be time for Australia to take another look at its gambling age laws.

#  Quebec Considers Lowering Legal Gambling Age

Quebec is mulling over a proposed bill that would lower the minimum legal gambling age from 18 to 16, making it the youngest jurisdiction in North America to do so.

The measure is part of a broader campaign by the Quebec government to increase its revenues from gambling, which have been declining in recent years. The province currently has the lowest gaming revenue per capita of any Canadian province.

To offset any potential losses in revenue associated with the lowered gambling age, the government has proposed increasing taxes on casinos and other forms of gambling. It has also pledged to invest more money into addiction prevention and treatment programs.

While there is no official word yet on when a vote on the proposed bill will take place, it is expected to happen before the end of the year.
