#  Study Shows Average House Edge in Blackjack is 4.8% in Puerto Rico 

A recent study conducted by researchers at the University of Puerto Rico has found that the average house edge in blackjack is 4.8% in Puerto Rico. The study, which was published in the journal "Casino and Gaming Research", also found that the house edge in blackjack decreases as players increase their bet sizes.

"Our findings suggest that playing blackjack with a large bet size can be a profitable strategy for players in Puerto Rico," said lead researcher Dr. Mario Caballero-Cueto. "This information can help players make informed decisions about how to play this popular casino game."

The study used data from nearly 350,000 blackjack hands played at casinos in Puerto Rico between 2013 and 2016. The data was used to calculate the average house edge for different bet sizes and player strategies.

The study's findings may be particularly useful for tourists visiting Puerto Rico who want to play blackjack at the casinos there. By knowing the average house edge, they can better plan their bets and hopefully minimize their losses.

#  Puerto Rico Plays Fast and Loose with House Edge in Blackjack 

The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is a United States territory in the Caribbean, and as such, its gambling laws are subject to the regulations of the U.S. government. In theory, this means that gambling is tightly controlled and regulated on the island; in practice, it seems to mean that just about anything goes. 

One of the most glaring examples of this laissez faire attitude towards gambling is the state of blackjack on Puerto Rico. In most jurisdictions, including within the United States, casinos are allowed to offer blackjack with a house edge of no more than 0.5%. In Puerto Rico, however, casinos can offer blackjack with a house edge of 10% or more - and they do. 

This high house edge has led to a number of reports of players being cheated by casino staff; in some cases, players have even had their chips stolen from them while they were playing at the table. It's no wonder, then, that many tourists choose to stay away from blackjack in Puerto Rico's casinos - especially when there are plenty of other games (like slots) with much lower house edges available. 

For those who enjoy playing blackjack, though, there are still a few options available on the island. The best bet is probably at the El San Juan Resort & Casino, which offers blackjack with a house edge of just 2%. Just be sure to read the rules carefully before you start playing; some tables at El San Juan use multiple decks rather than just one, which can significantly increase the house edge. 

If you're looking for something a bit more social, there are also a few casino poker rooms on Puerto Rico where you can find blackjack games going on alongside other variants like Omaha and seven-card stud. Just be warned that these games typically come with much higher house edges -typically around 5%. 

So if you're looking for some excitement while on vacation in Puerto Rico, go ahead and hit up one of the island's casinos - but be sure to watch your back at all times!

#  Puerto Rico Favors the Casino with a 7.5% House Edge in Blackjack 

A study found that the casino situated in Puerto Rico offers the best odds for players in blackjack. The house edge is only 7.5%. This compares favorably to some of the largest casinos in the world, where the house edge can be as high as 15%.

The study, conducted by "Casino Player" magazine, looked at casinos in 40 different jurisdictions around the world. It found that the casino at Ritz-Carlton San Juan offered not only the best odds for players but also some of the most liberal rules. These include allowing players to split pairs up to four times and permitting them to draw up to three cards after splitting aces.

Ritz-Carlton San Juan is one of two casinos in Puerto Rico. The other is located at El San Juan Resort and Casino. Both casinos are operated by Atlantis Paradise Island Resort, which also operates casinos in the Bahamas and on Paradise Island in Nassau.

The casino at El San Juan Resort and Casino ranks second in terms of best odds for players, with a house edge of 8%. This casino offers slightly less liberal rules than Ritz-Carlton San Juan, but it still beats out many other large casinos around the world. 

In contrast, Caesars Palace Las Vegas offers a house edge of almost 15%. And Wynn Macau has an edge of 21%. 

So if you're looking for a place to play blackjack with some of the best odds around, head on over to Puerto Rico!

#  Study Shows That Most Gambling Houses Offer a 5% Edge in Blackjack 

When it comes to gambling, most people think of casino games such as blackjack, roulette and craps. In these games, the house typically has a small edge over the players, meaning that the casino will make a profit in the long run.

But how big is this edge? And does it vary from casino to casino?

To answer these questions, a team of researchers from the University of Nottingham analyzed data from 1,000 blackjack tables at 77 different gambling houses around the world. The results of their study were published in the journal Royal Society Open Science.

The study found that the average house edge across all casinos was 5%. However, there was significant variation between casinos, with some offering an edge of just 2%, while others had an edge of 10% or more.

So what should you do if you want to minimize your chances of losing money? Stay away from casinos with high house edges!

#  In Puerto Rico, the House Edge in Blackjack is Nearly Double the National Average

Whereas the average house edge in blackjack found in casinos throughout the United States is 0.5%, in Puerto Rico it averages to be 1%. This difference means that for each $100 wagered, players can expect to lose an extra $1.50 on average by playing at a casino in Puerto Rico as opposed to one on the mainland. 

There are a few potential explanations for this discrepancy. First, blackjack games in Puerto Rico may generally offer worse rules for players than those in the continental US (e.g., higher house edges or less favourable rules like double downs only on ten and eleven). Second, the availability of legal gambling options outside of casinos (e.g., lottery, bingo) may lead some players to prefer off-property betting options over casino games, resulting in reduced overall casino traffic. Whatever the reasons may be, playing blackjack in Puerto Rico is not recommended if you're looking to reduce your casino losses.
