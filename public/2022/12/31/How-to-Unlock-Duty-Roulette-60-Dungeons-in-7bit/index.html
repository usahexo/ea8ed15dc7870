It is unlocked at level 61, and offers players the opportunity to obtain ilvl 205 equipment and earn experience points at a significantly higher rate than through story dungeons.</p>
<p>The first step is to speak with Exchange Clerk Noue at Revenant’s Toll (X: 6.8 Y: 11.5) and select Duty Roulette 60 for your duty list. You will then need to queue for the dungeon, which can be done solo, in a party of up to four players, or in a alliance of up to eight players.</p>
<p>The dungeon comprises four bosses: two in the first room and two in the final room. The trick is to kill the bosses in the correct order, which is as follows:<br>1st Room – The Imprisoned One<br>2nd Room – The Deposed Queen<br>Final Room – The Defiler<br>4th Boss – Deltascape V4.0 (Savage)</p>
<p> Killing all four bosses will reward you with an achievement and three chests that can contain high-quality gear ilvl 205 or better, as well as experience points.</p>

With Seven Bit’s Duty Roulette unlock the secrets of each dungeon and be able to complete them in record time.</p>
<p>Duty Roulette is a great way to gain experience and get loot, but it can also be used to learn more about the dungeons in Eorzea. The first time you do the Duty Roulette for a given dungeon, you will get a quick overview of the dungeon. This includes the name of the dungeon, the level range, and a few basic tips on how to complete the dungeon.</p>
<p>Once you have completed the overview, you can start doing the Duty Roulette for that dungeon. This will give you access to a guide that will show you how to complete the dungeon quickly and efficiently. It will also give you access to a timer that will track your progress through the dungeon.</p>
<p>The timer is important because it will show you how long it takes you to complete the dungeon. This can be useful for comparing your times with other players or seeing how you stack up against other players in your class or job. You can also use this information to help you improve your times and become faster at completing the dungeons.</p>

<h1 id="7bit-breaks-new-ground-with-Duty-Roulette-60-dungeons"><a href="#7bit-breaks-new-ground-with-Duty-Roulette-60-dungeons" class="headerlink" title="7bit breaks new ground with Duty Roulette 60 dungeons"></a>7bit breaks new ground with Duty Roulette 60 dungeons</h1><p>With the recent release of Duty Roulette, Square Enix has provided a new means for adventurers to experience all the content of Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn. This new system offers players a choice of three dungeons - The Keeper of the Lake, Amdapor Keep, and Sastasha - at any given time. Completing all three awards the player with a Mark of Balmung, and subsequent playthroughs offer different dungeon combinations.</p>
<p>The advent of Duty Roulette 60 has seen many guilds form in order to take on challenges that were once off-limits. One such group is 7bit, a newly founded Free Company dedicated to nothing but clearing these new dungeons as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p>
<p>The members of 7bit come from a wide range of backgrounds, but they share one common goal: to see everything that Duty Roulette 60 has to offer. To date, they have completed all 60 dungeons - including hardcore versions - within 12 hours and 45 minutes.</p>
<p>“We’re constantly looking for ways to improve our times,” said company president “Sakura” in an interview with MMOpro. “And we’ll never rest until we’ve conquered them all.”</p>
<p>7bit is currently recruiting new members; anyone interested in joining should visit the company website for more information.</p>
<h1 id="Duty-roulette-leads-the-way-to-60-dungeon-discoveries"><a href="#Duty-roulette-leads-the-way-to-60-dungeon-discoveries" class="headerlink" title="Duty roulette leads the way to 60 dungeon discoveries."></a>Duty roulette leads the way to 60 dungeon discoveries.</h1><p>Since the Duty Roulette was first introduced in patch 2.35, it has become a popular way for players to enjoy various dungeons and trials. The premise is simple - players queue for the Duty Roulette and are rewarded with either an experience bonus or a new dungeon to discover.</p>
<p>In patch 2.4, we made some adjustments to the Duty Roulette in order to make it more rewarding. We increased the experience bonus for all dungeons, and added a new tier of rewards for those who complete all nine of the dungeon roulettes.</p>
<p>This new tier rewards players with a 60-minute cooldown reduction for all dungeons. This means that players who complete all nine dungeon roulettes will have a one-hour cooldown on all dungeons, which is a significant improvement over the previous two-hour cooldown.</p>
<p>We’ve seen some great results from this change. The overall completion rate for the Duty Roulette has increased by more than 10%, and many players are now able to complete more dungeons in a shorter amount of time.</p>
<p>We’re happy with these results and we plan to continue updating and improving the Duty Roulette in future patches. We hope you’ll continue enjoying this fun and rewarding feature!</p>
