            <h1 id="Nevada-Now-Allows-Gambling-On-Line"><a href="#Nevada-Now-Allows-Gambling-On-Line" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Now Allows Gambling On-Line"></a>Nevada Now Allows Gambling On-Line</h1><p>Nevada is the latest state to legalize gambling on-line. The new law, which takes effect on October 1st, will allow licensed casinos in the state to offer their games over the internet.</p>
<p>Governor Brian Sandoval, who signed the bill into law, said that it would create much-needed jobs in the state and generate millions of dollars in tax revenue. “This is a great day for Nevada,” he said. “The passage of this bill will see our state’s gaming industry continue to thrive and generate much-needed revenue for our schools and other important services.”</p>
<p>Opponents of online gambling say that it can be addictive and lead to financial ruin for vulnerable people. But Governor Sandoval dismissed these concerns, saying that “responsible gambling” would be enforced through regulation.</p>
<p>Under the new law, Nevada residents will be able to gamble on casino games such as blackjack, roulette and poker, as well as slot machines and other slot games. The minimum age for gambling online will be 21, and players will be able to bet up to $10 per game.</p>
<p>Operators of online casinos will have to pay a licensing fee of $500,000, and must also agree to contribute 10% of their gross gaming revenue to a fund that supports problem gambling prevention and treatment.</p>
<p>The new law has been welcomed by the casino industry in Nevada, which accounts for one-fifth of the state’s GDP. “We’re excited about it,” said William Hill US CEO Joe Asher. “It should open up a whole new audience of people who want to gamble but don’t want to leave their house.”</p>
<h1 id="New-Jersey-Nets-12-Million-In-On-Line-Gambling-Revenue-In-First-Month"><a href="#New-Jersey-Nets-12-Million-In-On-Line-Gambling-Revenue-In-First-Month" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey Nets $12 Million In On-Line Gambling Revenue In First Month"></a>New Jersey Nets $12 Million In On-Line Gambling Revenue In First Month</h1><p>The New Jersey Nets are enjoying some serious financial success in their first month of on-line gambling operations.</p>
<p>The team has reported $12 million in revenue from its on-line gambling business, a figure that is already more than the team’s total revenue from last year. The Nets are one of six NBA teams to offer on-line gambling this season, and they are the only one to do so from within the United States.</p>
<p>“This is a very exciting time for our franchise,” said Brett Yormark, CEO of the Nets. “We believe that on-line gambling will be a major part of our business going forward, and we are off to a terrific start.”</p>
<p>Gambling experts say that the Nets’ early success is due largely to the strong partnerships they have formed with leading gaming providers. In addition to offering a wide variety of betting options, the Nets have partnered with some of the biggest names in gaming, including DraftKings, FanDuel and MGM Resorts.</p>
<p>“The Nets have done an excellent job establishing themselves as one of the top destinations for online gambling,” said Darren Heitner, founder of Sports Agent Blog. “They have a great selection of games and betting options, and they have partnered with some of the biggest names in the industry. That combination has made them a force to be reckoned with.”</p>
<p>Yormark says that the team is already working on ways to improve its on-line gambling business even further. One priority is expanding its reach into new markets such as China and Europe. The Nets are also looking into ways to make it easier for fans to bet on games.</p>
<p>“We want to make it as easy as possible for our fans to bet on our games,” said Yormark. “We want them to feel like they are part of the team, and that they have a stake in our success. On-line gambling is a major part of our strategy going forward, and we plan to continue building on our early success.”</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Sees-Huge-Success-in-First-Week-of-On-Line-Gambling"><a href="#Delaware-Sees-Huge-Success-in-First-Week-of-On-Line-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Sees Huge Success in First Week of On-Line Gambling"></a>Delaware Sees Huge Success in First Week of On-Line Gambling</h1><p>Delaware has seen a great success in the first week of on-line gambling, with $1.3 million wagered so far.</p>
<p>This is a fantastic start for Delaware’s new on-line gambling platform, which launched earlier this month. The platform offers a variety of games, including slots, blackjack, and roulette.</p>
<p>Players can access the platform from their computer or mobile device, making it easy to enjoy a game of chance whenever they please.</p>
<p>Delaware is one of only three states in the US to offer on-line gambling. The other states are Nevada and New Jersey.</p>
<p>While it is still early days, it looks like Delaware’s on-line gambling platform is off to a strong start. This is great news for the state, as it looks to boost its tourism industry and create jobs.</p>
<h1 id="Illinois-Governor-Pat-Quinn-Supports-legalizing-on-line-gambling"><a href="#Illinois-Governor-Pat-Quinn-Supports-legalizing-on-line-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Illinois Governor Pat Quinn Supports legalizing on-line gambling"></a>Illinois Governor Pat Quinn Supports legalizing on-line gambling</h1><p>The Governor of Illinois, Pat Quinn, has come out in support of legalizing on-line gambling in the state. The governor believes that this would be a great way to generate much needed revenue for the state. He also believes that it would be a great way to help keep Illinois residents employed.</p>
<p>The governor’s proposal would allow for on-line gambling sites to be licensed and regulated by the state. This would include sites that offer casino games, poker, and sports betting. Revenue from the licensing fees and taxes on the gambling sites would be used to help fund education and infrastructure projects in Illinois.</p>
<p>The governor’s proposal has generated a lot of support from lawmakers in Illinois. Many of them believe that it is a great way to help solve the state’s budget problems. However, there are also some who are concerned about the potential for addiction and social problems that could come with legalized on-line gambling.</p>
<p>The governor is hopeful that his proposal will be approved by the state legislature this year. If it is, Illinois will become one of the first states in the nation to legalize on-line gambling.</p>
<h1 id="California-Considers-Allowing-On-line-Gambling"><a href="#California-Considers-Allowing-On-line-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="California Considers Allowing On-line Gambling"></a>California Considers Allowing On-line Gambling</h1><p>After years of opposition, the state of California is considering legalizing online gambling.</p>
<p>Supporters of the measure argue that it would generate much-needed revenue for the state, while opponents say it would lead to increased addiction and crime.</p>
<p>The proposal, which is currently being debated in the state legislature, would allow people over the age of 21 to gamble on websites and apps licensed by the state.</p>
<p>It would also prohibit Californians from gambling on websites based in other states or countries.</p>
<p>If approved, California would become the fourth state in the US to legalize online gambling, after New Jersey, Delaware, and Nevada.</p>
<p>Supporters of online gambling argue that it is a safe and convenient way to gamble, and that it would generate significant tax revenue for the state.</p>
<p>They say that it would be particularly beneficial for smaller rural casinos, which could not compete with larger casinos in major cities.</p>
<p>Opponents of online gambling, meanwhile, argue that it is addictive and can lead to financial ruin for gamblers.</p>
<p>They also say that it can be used by criminals to launder money and finance terrorism.</p>
