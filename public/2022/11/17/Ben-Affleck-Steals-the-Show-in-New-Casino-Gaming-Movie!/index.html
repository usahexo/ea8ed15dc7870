<h1 id="Ben-Affleck’s-Latest-Film-Casino-Gaming-Blackjack-DoubleDown-Casino"><a href="#Ben-Affleck’s-Latest-Film-Casino-Gaming-Blackjack-DoubleDown-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Ben Affleck’s Latest Film: Casino Gaming Blackjack DoubleDown Casino"></a>Ben Affleck’s Latest Film: Casino Gaming Blackjack DoubleDown Casino</h1><p>Casino Royale fans who were eagerly anticipating the latest installment of the Bourne series, were surprised (and some disappointed) to find out that the new film was not about Jason Bourne, but his friend and associate, Ben Affleck. The movie, “Affleck”, is a biographical account of the actor’s early days in Hollywood as a struggling young actor and his rise to fame.</p>
<p>The most exciting part of the film for fans of casino gaming is a 45-minute blackjack double down casino scene in which Affleck and his friends take on an experienced casino player. The scene is particularly exciting because of the high stakes involved: Affleck and his friends are gambling with their livelihoods on the line.</p>
<p>The blackjack double down casino scene was shot at the real-life Hard Rock Casino in Las Vegas, and it’s clear that the filmmakers spared no expense in making it look as realistic as possible. The setting is authentic, right down to the dealer’s uniforms, and even the sound effects have been recorded live from a real casino floor.</p>
<p>The only thing that’s missing is the smell of cigarette smoke and spilled drinks!</p>
<p>If you’re a fan of blackjack or just want to see how Hollywood studios create realistic-looking scenes like this one, be sure to check out “Affleck” when it comes out on DVD.</p>
