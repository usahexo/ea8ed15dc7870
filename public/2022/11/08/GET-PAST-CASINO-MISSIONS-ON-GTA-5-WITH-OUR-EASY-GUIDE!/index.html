Aside from the many money-making methods available in the game, there are also casino missions that offer decent payouts. Completing these missions can be a little tricky, but with our guide, you can breeze through them in no time!</p>
<p><strong>Before you start, make sure you have a lot of cash on hand. The casino missions are not exactly cheap!</strong></p>
<p>#1: INTRODUCING CASINO MISSIONS<br>The casino missions are located at the [[Los Santos Casino]] and become available after completing the [[mission Nervous Ron]]. There are a total of six missions, and they must be completed in order. The rewards for each mission increase as you progress, so it’s best to complete them all as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>#2: THE FIRST CASINO MISSION – ‘PULL THE STRING’<br>The first casino mission is called ‘Pull the String’ and is fairly easy. You will be playing blackjack against a rival gang member, and your goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. You will also need to avoid going bust (going over 21). If you manage to win the hand, your rival will back down and the mission will be complete. If you lose, simply restart the checkpoint until you win.</p>
<p>#3: THE SECOND CASINO MISSION – ‘THE PEGASUS TAVERN’<br>The second casino mission is called ‘The Pegasus Tavern’ and is a little more difficult than the first. This time, you will be playing poker against three rival gang members. Your goal is to win two out of three hands. Again, if you lose just restart the checkpoint until you win.</p>
<p>#4: THE THIRD CASINO MISSION – ‘BIG RACE’<br>The third casino mission is called ‘Big Race’ and is by far the most difficult one yet. This time, you will be racing your rivals in a high stakes race around Los Santos. If you want to win this race, you will need some serious skills behind the wheel. Thankfully, we have a guide for that too! Check it out here: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.gtadriveguide.com/big-race-gta-5/">link</a>.</p>
<p>#5: THE FOURTH CASINO MISSION – ‘CHINATOWN WARS’<br>The fourth casino mission is called ‘Chinatown Wars’ and requires you to do a bit of hunting first. You need to track down five Triads who are holed up in different parts of Chinatown. Once you have found them all, kill them and return to the casino for your reward.</p>

One of the most loved aspects of the game is the casino missions. However, some people struggle to complete these missions, perhaps because they find them too difficult or time consuming. If you are one of these people, don’t worry – this guide is here to help you!</p>
<p>The key to completing the casino missions on GTA 5 is organisation and preparation. Before you even start the mission, make sure you have all of the items that you will need. This includes armour, weapons and vehicles. The last thing you want is to get half way through a mission and then realise that you don’t have the right weapon or vehicle.</p>
<p>Once you have everything you need, it’s time to start the mission. The first thing you need to do is head to the casino and get yourself set up in one of the gaming booths. Once you are in position, it’s time to start playing!</p>
<p>The key to completing these missions quickly and easily is to play strategically. Make sure you use your money wisely and only bet what you can afford to lose. Also, make sure you keep an eye on your progress – if things are starting to go wrong, it might be time to quit while you’re ahead!</p>
<p>If you follow these tips, you should be able to complete the casino missions on GTA 5 with ease!</p>
<h1 id="A-SIMPLE-GUIDE-ON-HOW-TO-GET-PAST-CASINO-MISSIONS-ON-GTA-5"><a href="#A-SIMPLE-GUIDE-ON-HOW-TO-GET-PAST-CASINO-MISSIONS-ON-GTA-5" class="headerlink" title="A SIMPLE GUIDE ON HOW TO GET PAST CASINO MISSIONS ON GTA 5!"></a>A SIMPLE GUIDE ON HOW TO GET PAST CASINO MISSIONS ON GTA 5!</h1><p>The casino missions on GTA 5 can be a bit of a pain, but with this guide you should be able to complete them with ease!</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First, you’ll want to head to the casino and talk to the manager. He’ll give you a few missions to complete.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The first mission is pretty simple; just play some blackjack and make sure to beat the dealer’s hand.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The second mission is a bit more complicated. You’ll need to make a large amount of money by playing roulette. The best way to do this is to bet on red or black and then double your bet after every loss.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The final mission is again pretty simple. Just play some slots and make sure to get three of the same symbols in a row.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="LEARN-HOW-TO-SKIP-CASINO-MISSIONS-ON-GTA-5-EASILY"><a href="#LEARN-HOW-TO-SKIP-CASINO-MISSIONS-ON-GTA-5-EASILY" class="headerlink" title="LEARN HOW TO SKIP CASINO MISSIONS ON GTA 5 EASILY!"></a>LEARN HOW TO SKIP CASINO MISSIONS ON GTA 5 EASILY!</h1><p>If you’re looking to skip some of the casino missions on Grand Theft Auto 5, look no further! In this guide, we’ll teach you how to do just that with ease.</p>
<p>The first step is to make your way over to the casino in Vinewood. Once there, you’ll want to speak with Lester Crest. Lester will give you a mission to break into the casino’s security room and steal the keycard that will allow you to access the high roller area.</p>
<p>Once you have the keycard, make your way up to the high roller area and speak with Mr. Cheng. Cheng will give you a mission to win $1,000,000 at the casino’s blackjack tables.</p>
<p>The easiest way to complete this mission is by playing blackjack perfectly. If you’re not familiar with the game, we suggest reading our blackjack guide [insert link].</p>
<p>Once you’ve won $1,000,000 at the blackjack tables, return to Mr. Cheng and he’ll give you another mission. This time, he wants you to break into his safe and steal his cash. The safe is located in his office on the third floor of the casino.</p>
<p>The easiest way to get past security and into Cheng’s office is by using a disguise. You can find several disguises scattered throughout the casino. Once inside Cheng’s office, locate the safe and hack it open using your hacking abilities. Steal Cheng’s cash and return to Lester for your final reward!</p>
<h1 id="GET-PAST-THE-CASINO-MISSIONS-ON-GTA-5-IN-NO-TIME-AT-ALL"><a href="#GET-PAST-THE-CASINO-MISSIONS-ON-GTA-5-IN-NO-TIME-AT-ALL" class="headerlink" title="GET PAST THE CASINO MISSIONS ON GTA 5 IN NO TIME AT ALL!"></a>GET PAST THE CASINO MISSIONS ON GTA 5 IN NO TIME AT ALL!</h1><p>If you’re looking to get past the casino missions on GTA 5 quickly, there are a few things you can do. For starters, make sure you stock up on plenty of armor and weapons before starting the casino missions. This will help you out immensely as you’ll need all the firepower you can get to take down the enemies in these missions.</p>
<p>In addition, it’s also a good idea to save your game frequently as you’ll likely need to restart a few times before completing the casino missions. When you’re ready to start the mission, head over to the casino and speak with Lester. He’ll give you a rundown of what needs to be done and then it’s time to get started.</p>
<p>The first mission is relatively easy, but things get tougher in later missions. Make sure you use all of your firepower wisely and take down enemies as quickly as possible. Also, make sure to pick up any health or armor items that are dropped by enemies so that you stay alive and well-protected during the mission.</p>
<p>Once you’ve completed the casino missions, congratulations! You’ve officially completed one of the tougher challenges in GTA 5.</p>
